Eventually this will allow you to generate chunks of manager and pundit speak. 
v0.1 attempted to make it with ejs - abandoned after setting up pages once i realised i couldn't pull the .js data through to an ejs page
v0.2 recreated project in an html page using the same .js - just the manager speak at this point, genrtaed 3 bits of texts from an array, further owrk needed to make it better/funny
v0.21 linked up with github, got rid of junked files, should allow this working demo to display online
