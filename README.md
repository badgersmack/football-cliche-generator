Eventually this will allow you to generate chunks of manager and pundit speak. 
v0.1 attempted to make it with ejs - abandoned after setting up pages once i realised i couldn't pull the .js data through to an ejs page
v0.2 recreated project in an html page using the same .js - just the manager speak at this point, genrtaed 3 bits of texts from an array, further owrk needed to make it better/funny
v0.21 linked up with github, got rid of junked files, should allow this working demo to display online
v0.3 more functionality, still need to make it look nicer
v0.4 made it look a bit nicer
