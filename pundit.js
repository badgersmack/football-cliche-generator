13 He's lost the dressing room
14 He fell into the offside trap
15 He's got genuine pace
16 Away goals count double
17 It could be a cricket score
18 A good time to score
19 A team that likes to play football
20 In his locker
21 This game needs a goal
22 You can't win the title in August but you can lose it
23 He was in acres of space

24 A no-nonsense player
25 He'll have nightmares about that for years
26 That was a great cross but there was no one there
28 Some tired legs out there
29 A bit of 'handbags' going on there
30 Beckham territory
not for me clive
3 Goals wins games
4 They scored too early
5 He certainly knows where the goal is
6 If that was on target, it would have been a goal
7 Schoolboy defending
8 Good squad on paper
9 Yard of pace
10 Your Rooneys/Lampards/whoevers
11 Cultured left foot
12 He gave 110%
